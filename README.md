Research Abstract:
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1 in 36 children in the United States, yet lacks a definitive diagnostic method, often relying on subjective assessments. This study aims to develop a precise diagnostic model for ASD using fMRI scans and machine learning algorithms. Data collection, preprocessing, and feature extraction were conducted on preprocessed timeseries data obtained from the ABIDE Preprocessed database. This timeseries data, monitoring BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) signals across various brain regions over time, forms the basis for analysis due to its correlation with neural activity. After performing oversampling and normalization on the timeseries data, machine learning algorithms were applied to this data after splitting it into training and testing sets via k-fold cross validation, with performance evaluated using sensitivity and specificity metrics. Initial experimentation revealed Logistic Regression as the most effective algorithm, though overall sensitivity and specificity remained around 60%. Future modifications to the model, such as testing neural networks and exploring other types of data apart from the BOLD signal, are suggested to improve performance by 10-15%. These findings underscore the potential of fMRI and machine learning in ASD diagnosis, promising enhanced methodologies in the future.
